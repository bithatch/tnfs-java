This group contains desktop user interface applications that are part of TNFS Java.

## Drives

A small desktop application that makes accessing TNFS servers on your network or the Internet a breeze. You can add your favourite TNFS server, or let Drive find servers on your LAN. You can then mount any such server and access files as any others on your local system. All without touching a configuration file or command line.
